<h2 class="sans">THE CLOSURE AT HOME.</h2>

<p>Paterfamilias entered the
drawing-room at ten minutes
to six o'clock, and found the
family still undecided. There
was a pause in the conversation
when he made his appearance.</p>

<p>"Where are we to go?" he
asked, taking out his watch.
"You have been quarrelling
for the last week, and I have
given you till this hour. So
get through your amendments
as fast as you can."</p>

<p>"I prefer Paris," said
Materfamilias, "and I am
supported by all the girls.
We are decidedly in a majority."</p>

<p>"Paris is simply awful at
the end of July!" cried the
eldest son. "Give you my
word, mother, the place is
impossible."</p>

<p>"Venice would certainly be
better," said his younger
brother. "Charming place,
and you get a very decent
<i>table d'hôte</i> at <span class="sc">Danieli's</span>."</p>

<p>"Oh, Venice is too dreadful
just now!" exclaimed Aunt
<span class="sc">Matilda</span>. "If <i>we</i> are to go
with you, we certainly can't
travel there. Besides, there's
the cholera all over the Continent.
Now Oban would be
nice."</p>

<p>"Are you speaking seriously?"
asked Cousin <span class="sc">Jane</span>.
"Scotland never agrees with
me, but Cairo would be
perfect."</p>

<p>"Do you think so, my dear
girl?" put in Uncle <span class="sc">John</span>.
"I fancy you are making a
mistake. Egypt is very well
in the winter, but it is fearfully
hot in August. Now
they tell me Killarney is
simply delightful at this
season."</p>

<p>"Ireland! No, thank you!"
exclaimed <span class="sc">Reginald</span>. "We
have had enough of Home
Rule on this side of the
Channel to go across to find it
on the other. No; give me
Spain, or even Russia."</p>

<p>The hands of the clock were
close upon the hour, but still
there was a minute or so to
spare.</p>

<p>"Russia indeed!" snapped
out <span class="sc">Priscilla</span>. "Who ever
would go to Russia? But
people do tell me that Chicago
is well worth seeing, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment the clock
struck six.</p>

<p>"Time's up," cried Paterfamilias.
"We will all go to
Herne Bay."</p>

<p>And they did.</p>

<h2>CRICKET ACROSS THE CHANNEL.</h2>

<p>We believe that our lively neighbours, the French, having seen
that there is a chance of some alteration being made in the rules of
cricket in England, have determined to suggest some changes on
their own account. We give the first list of proposals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/061b-300.png"><img src="images/061b-150.png" width="150" height="184" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>1. The ball in future is to be made of india-rubber.</p>

<p>2. Armour to be allowed to the striker, so
as to prevent accidents from the ball.</p>

<p>3. The umpires to be henceforth experienced
surgeons, so that their medical services may
be available for the wounded.</p>

<p>4. Camp-stools to be permitted to the long-stop,
and other hard-worked members of the
field.</p>

<p>5. Fielders expected to run after a rapidly-driven
ball, to be allowed to follow the object
on bicycles.</p>

<p>6. The wicket-keeper to have a small portable fortress in front of
him to keep him out of danger.</p>

<p>7. The bats to be made of the same materials as those used in
lawn-tennis.</p>

<p>8. The game to commence with the "luncheon interval," to be
employed in discussing a <i>déjeuner à la fourchette</i>.</p>

<p>9. The uniform of the cricketer in future to consist of a horn, a
hunting-knife, jockey-cap and fishing-boots, in fact the costume of
the earliest French exponent of the game.</p>

<p>10. The outside to have the right to declare the game closed when
fatigued.</p>

<p>11. A band of music to be engaged to play a popular programme.
A flourish of trumpets to announce the triumph of the striker when
he succeeds in hitting the ball.</p>

<p>12. Those who take part in the great game to be decorated with a
medal. All future matches to be commemorated with clasps, to
denote the player's bravery.</p>

<p>Should these reforms be adopted by the M. C. C., there seems little
doubt that the national game of England will receive a fresh lease of
popularity in the land that faces Albion.</p>

<h2>THE LATEST CRISIS.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
[Mr. <span class="sc">Bartley</span> protested in the House of Commons against Mr. W.
<span class="sc">O'Brien's</span> conduct in dining in the House with strangers at a table reserved
for Members. Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> explained that Mr. <span class="sc">Austen Chamberlain</span> had
taken a table which he (Mr. <span class="sc">O'Brien</span>) had previously reserved. The
question is under the consideration of the Kitchen Committee.]
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A crisis! A crisis! The man is a fool</p>
<p>Who desires at this moment to talk of Home Rule.</p>
<p>Though we know that in Egypt a something is rotten,</p>
<p>The intrigues of young <span class="sc">Abbas</span> are straightway forgotten;</p>
<p>And we think just as much of the woes of Siam</p>
<p>As we care for that coin of small value&mdash;a <i>dam</i>.</p>
<p>For a crisis has come, and the House is unable</p>
<p>To detach its attention from questions of table.</p>
<p>Their tongues and their brains all the Members exhaust in</p>
<p>Discussing the rights of <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> and <span class="sc">Austen</span>.</p>
<p>They debate in an access of anger and gloom</p>
<p>As to who took from which what was kept, and for whom.</p>
<p>The letters they wrote, the retorts they made tartly</p>
<p>Are detailed&mdash;gracious Powers preserve us&mdash;by <span class="sc">Bartley</span>,</p>
<p>Who can bend&mdash;only statesmen are formed for such feats&mdash;</p>
<p>His mind, which is massive, to questions of seats,</p>
<p>And discuss with a zest which is equal to <span class="sc">Tanner's</span>,</p>
<p>The absorbing details of a matter of manners.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Bartley</span> you like to be heard than to hear</p>
<p>Far more, but, forgive me, a word in your ear.</p>
<p>Though we greatly rejoice when all records are cut</p>
<p>By your steam-hammer mind in thus smashing a nut,</p>
<p>Yet we think it were well if the Kitchen could settle</p>
<p>In private this question of pot <i>versus</i> kettle.</p>
<p>And in future, when dog-like men fight for a bone,</p>
<p>Take a hint, Mr. <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, and leave them alone.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER SCENE AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<h4>(<i>That never should be tolerated.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Auditorium of a Fashionable Theatre. Vast majority of
the audience deeply interested in the action and dialogue of an
excellent piece. Enter a party of Lady Emptyheads into a
Private Box.</i></p>

<p><i>First Emptyhead (taking off her wraps).</i> I told you there was no
necessity to hurry away from dinner. You see they are getting on
very well without us.</p>

<p><i>Second Empt. (seating herself in front of the box).</i> Yes. And it's
so much pleasanter to chat than to listen. This piece, they tell me,
is full of clever dialogue&mdash;so satisfactory to people who like that sort
of thing.</p>

<p><i>Third Empt. (looking round the house with an opera-glass).</i> Why
scarcely a soul in the place we know. Well, I suppose everybody is
leaving town. Stay, is that Mrs. <span class="sc">Evergreen Toffy</span>?</p>

<p><i>Fourth Empt. (also using her glasses).</i> Why, yes. I wish we
could make her see us.</p>

<p><i>First Empt.</i> Haven't you noticed that you never can attract
attention when you want to? Isn't it provoking?</p>

<p><i>Second Empt.</i> Oh, terribly; and there is Captain <span class="sc">Dashalong</span>.
Why, I thought he was at Aldershot.</p>

<p><i>Third Empt.</i> Oh, they always give them leave about this time of
the year.</p>

<p><i>Rest of Audience (sternly).</i> Hush! S-s-s-h-s-h!</p>

<p><i>Fourth Empt.</i> I wonder what's the piece about.</p>

<p><i>Third Empt.</i> Oh, it doesn't in the least matter. Sure to be
sparkling. Do you like that woman's hair?</p>

<p><i>Fourth Empt.</i> Scarcely. It's the wrong shade. How can people
make such frights of themselves!</p>

<p><i>First Empt.</i> I wonder if this is the Second Act, or the First!</p>

<p><i>Third Empt.</i> What does it matter! I never worry about a
piece, for I know I shall see all about it afterwards in the
papers.</p>

<p><i>Rest of Audience (with increased sternness).</i> Hush! S-s-s-h-s-h!</p>

<p><i>Second Empt.</i> I always come to this theatre because the chairs are
comfortable. What is the good of going to the play unless you can
enjoy yourself?</p>

<p><i>Third Empt.</i> Quite so. And it's much better fun without one's
husband, isn't it?</p>

<p><i>First Empt.</i> Of course. I never bring mine, because he always
goes to sleep! So disrespectful to the actresses and actors!</p>

<p><i>Second Empt.</i> Yes. Of course, one ought to listen to what's going
on, even if you don't care what it's all about.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Empt.</i> Quite so. Not that it isn't pleasant to look round
the house.</p>

<p><i>Rest of Audience (angrier than ever).</i> Hush! S-s-s-h-s-h!</p>

<p><i>Third Empt.</i> Yes, I often think that this side of the curtain is
quite as amusing as the other.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Empt.</i> I wonder what they are doing on the stage? Oh, I
see that the Act is nearly over! Well, I daresay it has been very
amusing.</p>

<p><i>Rest of Audience (furious).</i> Hush! Hush! Hush!</p>

<p><i>First Empt.</i> There descends the curtain! By the way, what a
noise those people in the pit have been making! I wonder what it
was all about?</p>

<p><i>Second Empt.</i> I haven't the faintest notion. However, when the
play begins again, I hope they won't make any more noise. It is so
disrespectful to the Audience.</p>

<p><i>First Empt.</i> And the Company. Why can't people behave themselves
in a theatre?</p>

<p><i>Second, Third, and Fourth Empt. (in chorus).</i> Ah yes! Why
can't they?</p>

<h2>THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Cunnin Toil.</i>)</h4>

<h3>No. I.&mdash;THE BISHOP'S CRIME.</h3>

<p>I was sitting alone in my room at 10.29 on the night of the
14th of last November. I had been doing a good deal of work
lately, and I was tired. Moreover, I had had more than one touch
of that old Afghan fever, which always seemed to be much more
inclined to touch than to go. However, we can't have everything
here to please us; and as I had only the other day attended two
bankers and a Lord Mayor for <ins title="T.N.: Original reads 'measeles'">measles</ins>, I had no real cause to
complain of my prospects. I had drawn the old armchair in which
I was sitting close to the fire, and, not having any bread handy, I
was occupied in toasting my feet at the blaze when suddenly the
clock on the mantelpiece struck the half hour, and <span class="sc">Picklock
Holes</span> stood by my side. I was too much accustomed to his
proceedings to express any surprise at seeing him thus, but I own
that I was itching to ask him how he had managed to get into my
house without ringing the bell. However, I refrained, and motioned
him to a chair.</p>

<p>"My friend," said this extraordinary man, without the least preface,
"you've been smoking again. You know you have; it's not the least
use denying it." I absolutely gasped with astonishment, and gazed at
him almost in terror. How had he
guessed my secret? He read my
thoughts, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, simply enough. That spot on
your shirt-cuff is black. But it might
have been yellow, or green, or blue, or
brown, or rainbow-coloured. But I know
you smoke Rainbow mixture, and as your
canary there in the corner has just gone
blind, I know further that bird's-eye is
one of the component parts of the mixture."</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Holes</span>," I cried, dropping my old
meerschaum out of my mouth in my
amazement; "I don't believe you're a
man at all&mdash;you're a devil."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment," he
replied, without moving a single muscle
of his marble face. "You ought not to
sup&mdash;&mdash;" He was going to have added
"pose," but the first syllable seemed to
suggest a new train of thought (in which,
I may add, there was no second class
whatever) to my inexplicable friend.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "the devilled bones
were not good. Don't interrupt me; you
had devilled bones for supper, or rather
you would have had them, only you didn't like them. Do you see that
match? A small piece is broken off the bottom, but enough is left
to show it was once a lucifer&mdash;in other words, a devil. It is lying at
the feet of the skeleton which you use for your anatomical investigations,
and therefore I naturally conclude that you had devilled
bones for supper. You didn't eat them, <i>for not a single bone of the
skeleton is missing</i>. Do I make myself clear?"</p>

<p>"You do," I said, marvelling more than ever at the extraordinary
perspicacity of the man. As a matter of fact, my supper had consisted
of bread and cheese; but I felt that it would be in extremely
bad taste for a struggling medical practitioner like myself to contradict
a detective whose fame had extended to the ends of the earth.
I picked up my pipe, and relit it, and, for a few moments, we sat in
silence. At last I ventured to address him.</p>

<p>"Anything new?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly new," he said, wearily, passing his sinewy hand
over his expressionless brow. "Have you a special <i>Evening
Standard</i>? I conclude you have, as I see no other evening papers
here. Do you mind handing it to me?"</p>

<p>There was no deceiving this weird creature. I took the paper he
mentioned from my study table, and handed it to him.</p>

<p>"Now listen," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, and then read, in a voice devoid of
any sign of emotion, the following paragraph:&mdash;"This morning, as
Mrs. <span class="sc">Drabley</span>, a lady of independent means, was walking in
Piccadilly, she inadvertently stepped on a piece of orange-peel, and
fell heavily on the pavement. She was carried into the shop of
Messrs. <span class="sc">Salver and Tankard</span>, the well-known silversmiths, and it
was at first thought she had broken her right leg. However, on
being examined by a medical man who happened to be passing,
she was pronounced to be suffering from nothing worse than a
severe bruise, and, in the course of half-an-hour, she recovered
sufficiently to be able to proceed on her business. This is the
fifth accident caused by orange-peel at the same place within the
last week."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/069-700.png"><img src="images/069-400.png" width="400" height="392" alt="'The Bishop was in his night-gown'" /></a>
<p>"The Bishop was in his night-gown, and the sight of
two strangers visibly alarmed him."</p></div>

<p>"It <i>is</i> scandalous!" I broke in. "This mania for dropping orange-peel
is decimating London. Curiously enough I happen to be the
medical man who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; you are the medical man who was passing."</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Holes</span>," I ejaculated, "you are a magician."</p>

<p>"No, not a magician; only a humble seeker after truth, who
uses as a basis for his deduction some slight point that others are
too blind to grasp. Now you think the matter ends there. I don't.
I mean to discover who dropped that orange-peel. Will you help
me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will, but how do you mean to proceed? There must
be thousands of people who eat oranges every day in London."</p>

<p>"Be accurate, my dear fellow, whatever you do. There are
78,965, not counting girls. But this piece was not dropped by
a girl."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind; it is sufficient that I do know it. Read this,"
he continued, pointing to another column of the paper. This is
what I read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Missionary Enterprise.</span>&mdash;A great conference of American and
Colonial Bishops was held in Exeter Hall this afternoon. The proceedings
opened with an impassioned speech from the Bishop of
<span class="sc">Florida</span>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the rest," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, "that's quite enough.
Now read this":&mdash;</p>

<p>"The magnificent silver bowl to be
presented to the Bishop of Florida by
some of his English friends is now on
view at Messrs. <span class="sc">Salver and Tankard's</span>
in Piccadilly. It is a noble specimen of
the British silversmith's art." An elaborate
description followed.</p>

<p>"These paragraphs," continued <span class="sc">Holes</span>,
in his usual impassive manner, "give
me the clue I want. Florida is an
orange-growing country. Let us call on
the Bishop."</p>

<p>In a moment we had put on our hats,
and in another moment we were in a
Hansom on our way to the Bishop's
lodgings in Church Street, Soho. <span class="sc">Holes</span>
gained admittance by means of his skeleton
key. We passed noiselessly up the
stairs, and, without knocking, entered the
Bishop's bedroom. He was in his night-gown,
and the sight of two strangers
visibly alarmed him.</p>

<p>"I am a detective," began <span class="sc">Holes</span>.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Bishop, turning pale.
"Then I presume you have called about
that curate who disappeared in an alligator
swamp close to my episcopal palace
in Florida. It is not true that I killed him. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tush," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, "we are come about weightier matters.
This morning at half-past eleven your lordship was standing
outside the shop of <span class="sc">Salver and Tankard</span> looking at your presentation
bowl. You were eating an orange. You stowed the
greater part of the peel in your coat-tail pocket, but you dropped,
maliciously dropped, one piece on the pavement. Shortly afterwards
a stout lady passing by trod on it and fell. Have you anything
to say?"</p>

<p>The Bishop made a movement, but <span class="sc">Holes</span> was before-hand with
him. He dashed to a long black coat that hung behind the door,
inserted his hand deftly in the pocket, and pulled out the fragmentary
remains of a large Florida orange.</p>

<p>"As I supposed," he said, "a piece is missing."</p>

<p>But the miserable prelate had fallen senseless on the floor, where
we left him.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Holes</span>," I said, "this is one of your very best. How on earth
did you know you would find that orange-peel in his coat?"</p>

<p>"I didn't find it there," replied my friend; "I brought it with
me, and had it in my hand when I put it in his pocket. I knew
I should have to use strong measures with so desperate a
character. My dear fellow, all these matters require tact and
imagination."</p>

<p>And that was how we brought home the orange-peel to the
Bishop.</p>

<h2 class="sans">ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 31.</i>&mdash;No one who chanced last
Thursday to see <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span> and <span class="sc">Logan</span> engaged in controversy
on Front Opposition Bench would suspect them of essentially
retiring disposition. This conclusively proved to-night. Decided
on further consideration that something must really be done in
direction of modifying effects of Thursday's riot. Someone must
apologise. This put to <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span>, who delighted <span class="sc">Walrond</span>
with swiftness, even enthusiasm, of acquiescence.</p>

<p>"Right you are, dear boy," he cried. "I have thought so from
the first. Indeed I have publicly placed the matter in its true light.
Daresay you read my little affidavit written within an hour of what
I quite agree with the <span class="sc">Speaker</span> in alluding to as 'the regrettable
incident.' Here's what I said: 'To put a stop to his (<span class="sc">Logan's</span>)
aggressive conduct, I immediately seized him by the neck and
forcibly ejected him on to the floor of the House. That began the
scrimmage.' Then I go on to point the moral, though indeed it
points itself. This is where you and I particularly agree. 'In my
opinion the responsibility for the discreditable scene rests even more
with Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> than with Mr. <span class="sc">Logan</span>.' Yes,
<span class="sc">Walrond</span>, you
are quite right in what you are about to say. I have shown clearly
that Mr. G. was at the bottom of the whole business, and he should
apologise. Don't you think he'd better be brought in at the Bar?
And if he spent a night or two in the Clock Tower it would have
most wholesome effect, vindicate dignity of House, and prevent
recurrence of these regrettable scenes."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Walrond's</span> face a study, whilst <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span>, carried away
by enthusiasm of moment, rubbed his hands and smiled in anticipation
of the scene.</p>

<p>The Opposition Whip had tough job in hand. To <span class="sc">Fisher's</span> logical
mind the proposal that <i>he</i> should apologise was a <i>non sequitur</i>.
Why, what had he done? As he told House later, seeing <span class="sc">Logan</span>
come up and sit down on bench below him, he thought he was going
to strike him. Natural attitude for a man meaning to let out
straight from the shoulder at another is to sit down with back turned
towards intended victim. <span class="sc">Fisher's</span> quick intelligence taking whole
situation in at glance, he promptly proceeded to take in as much as
his hands would hold of the back of <span class="sc">Logan's</span> neck, with intent to
thrust him forth. That, as he wrote, "began the scrimmage."
In other words, Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> was responsible for the whole
business, even more so than <span class="sc">Logan</span>, who had wantonly brought the
back of his neck within reach of <span class="sc">Fisher's</span> hand.</p>

<p>However, there were reasons of State why the guilty should go
unpunished. Not the first time Innocency has been sacrificed that
Guilt might stalk through the land unfettered. <span class="sc">Fisher</span> would
apologise; but here again the untameably logical mind asserted
itself. <span class="sc">Logan</span> must apologise first. It was he who had been forcibly
ejected. On Thursday night <span class="sc">Fisher</span> had come up behind him;
<i>argal</i>, he must follow him now. Thus it was settled, or so understood.
But when critical moment arrived, House waiting for someone
to speak, hitch occurred. <span class="sc">Fisher</span> waited for <span class="sc">Logan</span>;
<span class="sc">Logan</span>, in
excess of politeness, hung back. Awkward pause. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
observed he had certainly understood something might be said by
the two gentlemen. Another pause. <span class="sc">Logan</span> and <span class="sc">Fisher</span> eyed each
other across the floor.</p>

<p>At length <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> interposed; gently, but firmly, drew
the coy <span class="sc">Fisher</span> to the front. His apology followed by one from the
lingering <span class="sc">Logan</span>. Scene ended amid mutual tears.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's all very well," said <span class="sc">Fisher</span>, wringing his
pocket-handkerchief
and glaring angrily at Mr. G. "But, after all, the real
criminal has escaped, and logic, as applicable to events of daily life,
has received a staggering blow."</p>

<h4>Another Injustice to Ireland.</h4></div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Some men are born to trouble as the sparks fly upwards.
Of these is <span class="sc">William O'Brien</span>. It would seem that fate had
expended its malignity when <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> deprived him of his
breeches. Now <span class="sc">Joseph</span> has appropriated his dinner-table. The
lynx eye of <span class="sc">Bartley</span> detected the irregularity which disclosed
existence of this fresh outrage. <span class="sc">Bartley</span> favourably known in House
as guardian of its honour and dignity. From time to time spirit
moves him suddenly to rise and point fat forefinger at astonished
Mr. G., whom he has discovered in some fresh design upon stability
of the Empire or symmetry of the Constitution. At stated hours,
formerly on Thursdays ten o'clock now generally on stroke of
midnight, he is seen and heard shouting "Gag! gag!"</p>

<p>"Odd," says Member for Sark, "how phrases change in similar
circumstances though at different epochs. When Closure first
invented, put in motion by dear <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>, and supported
by <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, <span class="sc">Jimmy Lowther</span>, and the rest, it
used
to be spoken resentfully of as 'pouncing.' Now it is 'gagging.'
But it is precisely the same, inasmuch as the minority
of the day, against whom it is enforced, denounce it as iniquitous,
whilst the majority, who took that view when they were on
other side of House, now regard it as indispensable to conduct
of public business. <span class="sc">Bartley</span> having lived through both epochs
is useful illustration of this tendency. When <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>
pounced on Irish members his lusty shout of approval used
to echo through House with only less volume than now his roar
of anguish goes up to glass roof when <span class="sc">Old Morality's</span> original
thumbscrews are fitted on him and his friends. A quaint,
mad world, my <span class="sc">Toby</span>."</p>

<p>To-night <span class="sc">Bartley</span> not so well-informed on subject as usual.
Thought it was <span class="sc">John Dillon</span>, who, acting the part of
<span class="sc">Amphitryon</span>,
piloted his guests within preserves of members' private
dining-room. Turned out it wasn't <span class="sc">Dillon</span> at all, but <span class="sc">William
O'Brien</span>, who in most tragic manner tells how, having secured
in advance a table for his guests, found when the dinner-hour
struck <span class="sc">Joseph</span> and his Brethren seated thereat, merrily profiting
by his forethought. Straightway <span class="sc">O'Brien</span> led his guests to
the table in members' room which Unionist Leaders have
marked for their own. This he appropriated, and there,
regardless of surprised looks from ex-ministers at adjoining
table, he truculently dined.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate," said <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>, that Man of Peace,
"I'm glad it wasn't mere English or Orangemen who were
thus treated. If <span class="sc">Joseph</span> had appropriated <span class="sc">Saunderson's</span> table,
the Colonel would have taken him in his arms, dropped him outside
on the Terrace, and, returning to his seat, ordered a fresh plate
of soup." <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Bartley</span> adds fresh dignity to
Parliamentary
debate.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Was it this day week the House was in volcanic upheaval,
with <span class="sc">Hayes Fisher</span>&mdash;or was it Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>?&mdash;clutching
<span class="sc">Logan</span> by the back of the neck, a mad mob mauling each other
round the white waistcoat of <span class="sc">Edward of Armagh</span>? According to
the almanack this is so; according to appearances an eternity and
a hemisphere divide the two scenes.</p>

<p>In Committee on Vote on Account; average attendance from twenty
to thirty. Orders bristle with amendments; papers read in support
of them; occasionally a Member follows with observations on topic
suggested; sometimes he doesn't; then next gentleman who has
prepared paper takes the floor; the audience turns over; goes to
sleep again; wakened by Chairman putting question "that Amendment
be withdrawn." Isn't even vigour sufficient to induce a division.</p>

<p>Only person free from somnolent influence of hour is Mr. G. Has
nothing to do in this galley; looks on wistfully whilst
<span class="sc">Lowther</span> (not <span class="sc">Jimmy</span>) talks about Vitu and the Pamirs;
<span class="sc">Jimmy</span> (<i>lui même</i>) is sarcastic on subject of Board of
Trade engaging in experiments in journalism; and
<span class="sc">Dicky Temple</span> wants to know all about reported modifications
in constitution of St. Paul's School by the
Charity Commissioners. Mr. G. liked to have offered few
remarks on one or all these subjects. <span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span>
nearly succeeded in drawing him. Dropping lightly out
of Siam, <i>viâ</i> Morocco, upon question of Collisions at Sea,
<span class="sc">Tommy</span> brought <span class="sc">Mundella</span> into full focus and fairly
floored him with a problem.</p>

<p>"Suppose," he said, "the right hon. gentleman were
at sea, and the whole fleet bore down upon him on the
weather bow. What would he do?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/072b-900.png"><img src="images/072b-300.png" width="300" height="255" alt="Reading the G. O. M. to sleep." /></a>
<h4>Reading the G. O. M. to sleep.</h4></div>

<p><span class="sc">Mundella</span> nonplussed. Mr. G. knew all about it;
would have answered right off and probably silenced
even <span class="sc">Tommy</span> with proposition of counter man&oelig;uvre. But
<span class="sc">Marjoribanks</span> kept relentless eye on him. Vote on
Account must be got through Committee to-night.
The less speaking the better; so with profound sigh
Mr. G. resisted the temptation and composed himself
to listen to <span class="sc">Leng's</span> paper on the prohibition of importation
of live cattle from Canada. Here was opportunity
of learning something which Mr. G. gratefully
welcomed. Gradually, as the new knight went on
reading extract after extract in level voice, remorselessly
deliberate, Mr. G.'s eyes closed, his head drooped, and in
full view of the crowded Strangers' Gallery he fell into peaceful,
childlike slumber.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Vote on Account passed Committee.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Morning sitting devoted to miscellaneous talk around
Ireland. Evening, a long <span class="sc">Storey</span> about iniquities of House of
Lords. The evening and the morning a dull day. Had time to
look over Mr. G.'s letter about retention of Irish Members. "What
do you think of it?" I asked the Member for Sark. "Haven't
read it," he said. "When I saw it was a column long, I knew
Mr. G. didn't want to say anything that would be understood.
When he does, a few lines suffice; when he doesn't, nothing less
than a column of print will serve."</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
